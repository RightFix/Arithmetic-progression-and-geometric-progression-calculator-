      <h2>Arithmetic Progression</h2><br>
      <p>Arithmetic Progression (AP) is a sequence of numbers in order, in which the difference between any two consecutive numbers is a constant value. It is also called Arithmetic Sequence. For example, the series of natural numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,… is an Arithmetic Progression, which has a common difference between two successive terms (say 1 and 2) equal to 1 (2 -1). Even in the case of odd numbers and even numbers, we can see the common difference between two successive terms will be equal to 2.</p><br><br>
<h3>Arithmetic Progression Formulas</h3><br>
<p>There are two major formulas we come across when we learn about Arithmetic Progression, which is related to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The nth term of AP</li>
<li>Sum of the first n terms</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us learn here both the formulas with examples.<br>
<h4>nth Term of an AP</h4><br>
The formula for finding the n-th term of an AP is:<br>
an = a + (n − 1) × d<br>
Where <br><br>

a = First term<br><br>

d = Common difference<br><br>

n = number of terms<br><br>

a<sub>n</sub> = nth term<br><br>

Example: Find the nth term of AP: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5…., an, if the number of terms are 15.<br><br>
Solution: Given, AP: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5…., an<br>
n=15<br>

By the formula we know, an = a+(n-1)d<br>

First-term, a =1<br>

Common difference, d=2-1 =1<br>

Therefore, a<sub>n</sub> = a <sub>15</sub> = 1+(15-1)1 = 1+14 = 15<br><br>

<p>Note: The behaviour of the sequence depends on the value of a common difference.<br>

If the value of “d” is positive, then the member terms will grow towards positive infinity<br>
If the value of “d” is negative, then the member terms grow towards negative infinity <br></p>

<h4>Sum of N Terms of AP</h4>
<p>For an AP, the sum of the first n terms can be calculated if the first term, common difference and the total terms are known. The formula for the arithmetic progression sum is explained below:</p>

Consider an AP consisting “n” terms.<br>

Sn = n/2[2a + (n − 1) × d]<br>
This is the AP sum formula to find the sum of n terms in series.<br>

<h4>Sum of AP when the Last Term is Given</h4>
Formula to find the sum of AP when first and last terms are given as follows:<br>
S  = n/2 (first term + last term)<br>
<table border="1">
<tr>
  <td>General Form of AP	</td>
<td>a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, . . .</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>The nth term of AP</td>
  <td>a<sub>n</sub> = a + (n – 1) × d</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
  <td>Sum of n terms in AP</td>	
<td>S = n/2[2a + (n − 1) × d]</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Sum of all terms in a finite AP with the last term as ‘l’</td><td>	n/2(a + l)</td></tr>

      <h2> Geometric Sequence /Progression</h2>
<p><br>A geometric progression or a geometric sequence is the sequence, in which each term is varied by another by a common ratio. The next term of the sequence is produced when we multiply a constant (which is non-zero) to the preceding term. It is represented by:<br><br>

a, ar, ar<sup>2</sup>, ar<sup>3</sup>, ar<sup>4</sup>, and so on.<br><br>

Where a is the first term and r is the common ratio.<br><br>

<p>Note: It is to be noted that when we divide any succeeding term from its preceding term, then we get the value equal to the common ratio.</p>

Suppose we divide the 3rd term by the 2nd term we get:<br><br>

ar<sup>2</sup>/ar = r<br><br>

In the same way:<br><br>

ar³/ar² = r<br><br>

ar⁴/a³ = r<br><br>

<h3>Properties of Geometric Progression (GP)</h3>
Some of the important properties of GP are listed below:<br>

<ul><li>Three non-zero terms a, b, c are in GP if and only if b2 = ac</li>
<li>In a GP,</li>
Three consecutive terms can be taken as a/r, a, ar<br>
Four consecutive terms can be taken as a/r<sup>3</sup>, a/r, ar, ar <sup>3</sup><br>
Five consecutive terms can be taken as a/r<sup>2</sup>, a/r, a, ar, ar<sup>2</sup><br>
<li>In a finite GP, the product of the terms equidistant from the beginning and the end is the same</li>
That means, t<sup>1</sup>.t<sup>n</sup> = t2.tn-1 = t3.tn-2 = …..<br>
<li>If each term of a GP is multiplied or divided by a non-zero constant, then the resulting sequence is also a GP with the same common ratio</li>
<li>The product and quotient of two GP’s is again a GP</li>
<li>If each term of a GP is raised to the power by the same non-zero quantity, the resultant sequence is also a GP</li>
<li>If a1, a2, a3,… is a GP of positive terms then log a1, log a2, log a3,… is an AP (arithmetic progression) and vice versa</li>
</ul>
<h3>General Form of Geometric Progression</h3>
The general form of Geometric Progression is:<br><br>

a, ar, ar<sup>2</sup>, ar<sup>3</sup>, ar<sup>4</sup>,…, arn-1<br><br>

Where,<br><br>

a = First term<br><br>

r = common ratio<br><br>

ar<sup>n-1</sup>  = nth term<br><br>


<h3>General Term or Nth Term of Geometric Progression</h3><br>
Let a be the first term and r be the common ratio for a Geometric Sequence.<br><br>

Then, the second term, a<sub>2</sub> = a × r = ar<br><br>

Third term, a<sub>3</sub> = a<sub>2</sub>× r = ar × r = ar<sup>2</sup><br><br>

Similarly, nth term, a <sub>n</sub> = ar<sup>n-1</sup><br><br>

Therefore, the formula to find the nth term of GP is:<br><br>

an = tn = arn-1<br><br>
Note: The nth term is the last term of finite GP.
<br><br>
<h3>Common Ratio of GP</h3><br>

Consider the sequence a, ar, ar<sup>2</sup>, ar<sup>3</sup>,……<br><br>

First term = a<br><br>

Second term = ar<br><br>

Third term = ar<sup>n</sup><br><br>

Similarly, nth term, t<sub>n</sub>= ar<sup>n-1</sup><br><br>

Thus, the common ratio of geometric progression formula is given as:<br><br>

Common ratio = (Any term) / (Preceding term)<br><br>

= t<sup>n</sup> / t<sup>n-1</sup><br><br>

= (ar <sup>n-1</sup>) /(ar <sup>n-2</sup>)<br><br>

= r<br>

Thus, the general term of a GP is given by arn-1 and the general form of a GP is a, ar, ar<sup>2</sup>,…..<br><br>

For Example: r = t2 / t1 = ar / a = r<br><br>

<h3>Sum of N term of GP</h3><br>
Suppose a, ar, ar<sup>2</sup>, ar<sup>3</sup>,……ar<sup>n-1</sup>  is the given Geometric Progression.<br><br>

Then the sum of n terms of GP is given by:<br><br>

Sn = a + ar + ar<sup>2</sup> + ar<sup>3</sup> +…+ <br><br>

The formula to find the sum of n terms of GP is:<br><br>

Sn = a[(r<sup>n</sup> – 1)/(r – 1)] if r ≠ 1 and r > 1<br><br>
Where<br><br>

a is the first term<br><br>

r is the common ratio<br><br>

n is the number of terms<br><br>

Also, if the common ratio is equal to 1, then the sum of the GP is given by:<br><br>

Sn = na if r = 1<br><br>

<h3>Types of Geometric Progression</h3><br><br>
Geometric progression can be divided into two types based on the number of terms it has. They are:<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Finite geometric progression (Finite GP)</li><br>
<li>Infinite geometric progression (Infinite GP)</li><br><br>  </ul>
These two GPs are explained below with their representations and the formulas to find the sum.<br><br>

Finite Geometric Progression<br>
The terms of a finite G.P. can be written as 
a, ar, ar<sup>2</sup>, ar<sup>3</sup>,……ar<sup>n-1</sup>is called finite geometric series.<br>

The sum of finite Geometric series is given by:<br>

S<sub>n</sub> = a[(r <sup>n</sup> – 1)/(r – 1)] if r ≠ 1 and r > 1<br><br>

Infinite Geometric Progression<br><br>
Terms of an infinite G.P. can be written as a, ar, ar<sup>2</sup>, ar<sup>3</sup>, ……ar<sup>n-1</sup>,…… is called infinite geometric series.<br>

The sum of infinite geometric series is given by:<br><br>

S <sub>n</sub> = a / 1 - r<br><br>
 
This is called the geometric progression formula of sum to infinity.
<br><br><h3>Geometric Progression Formulas</h3><br>
The list of formulas related to GP is given below which will help in solving different types of problems.<br><br>

<ul>
  <li>The general form of terms of a GP is a, ar, ar2, ar3, and so on. Here, a is the first term and r is the common ratio.</li>
<li>The nth term of a GP is Tn = arn-1</li>
<li>Common ratio = r = Tn/ Tn-1</li>
<li>The formula to calculate the sum of the first n terms of a GP is given by:<br><br>
Sn = a[(rn – 1)/(r – 1)] if r ≠ 1and r > 1<br><br>
Sn = a[(1 – rn)/(1 – r)] if r ≠ 1 and r < 1<br><br></li>
<li>The nth term from the end of the GP with the last term l and common ratio r = l/ [r(n – 1)].</li>
<li>The sum of infinite, i.e. the sum of a GP with infinite terms is S∞= a/(1 – r) such that 0 < r < 1.</li>
<li>If three quantities are in GP, then the middle one is called the geometric mean of the other two terms. </li>
<li>If a, b and c are three quantities in GP, then and b is the geometric mean of a and c. This can be written as b2 = ac or b =√ac</li>
<li>Suppose a and r be the first term and common ratio respectively of a finite GP with n terms. Thus, the kth term from the end of the GP will be = arn-k.</li>
</ul>
